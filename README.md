## Comparing ULIME with L2 LIME and Cosine LIME
* To compare L2 LIME, Cosine LIME and ULIME on a limited imagenet dataset, please open the following Jupyter Notebook in Google Colaboratory. 
* Instructions on how to run the code are given in the notebook. 
* The code has also been sufficiently commented. If something remains unclear, please reach out to minhaj3737@gmail.com. 
* Make sure you set the runtime in Colaboratory to GPU before running the notebook!

## Training a CNN model on Liver and Pancreatic Tumors
* The dataset has been kept private due to patient data confidentiality. However, the outputs from our actual experiments have been preserved. 
* Both liver_model.ipynb and pancreas_model.ipynb show the train/validation loss graphs and performance metrics of the trained models.

## Domain Specific Superpixelization
* The dataset has been kept private due to patient data confidentiality. However, the outputs from our actual experiments have been preserved. 
* domain_superpixelization.ipynb shows our superpixelization method applied on liver and pancreatic tumors.

Here are some of our domain specific superpixelization ULIME explanations for Liver and Pancreatic tumors, with comments from a radiologist (Dr. Richard Kinh Gian Do from the New York Sloan Kettering Cancer Research Center), verifying the explanations.
