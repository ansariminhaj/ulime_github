## Comparing ULIME with L2 LIME and Cosine LIME
* To compare L2 LIME, Cosine LIME and ULIME on a limited imagenet dataset, please open the following Jupyter Notebook in Google Colaboratory. 
* Instructions on how to run the code are given in the notebook. 
* The code has also been sufficiently commented. If something remains unclear, please reach out to minhaj3737@gmail.com. 
* Make sure you set the runtime in Colaboratory to GPU before running the notebook!
